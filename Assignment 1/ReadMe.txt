Part A:
For Part A, I added a green light source from the bottom, a Pokeball texture to the sphere geometry, and a vertex displacement to the torus knot, which rotates along the z-axis due
to the way I altered the normal.

Part B:
For Part B, I simply altered the matrix to apply a sharpen effect. I found the matrix via the Wikipedia article on kernels. I kept the face though. It's a perfect example.

Part C:
For Part C, I applied the 313 rule from the Softology link, which interchanges between 3 shades of blue.
